      <h1>Privacy and Security Policy</h1>

      <p>Your privacy is extremely important.</p>

      <p>Aside from the data you choose to submit to the service, no personal data is collected, stored, retained or sold. If you wish to remove previously uploaded data, please use the delete function provided within the service, or reach out to the administrator who gave you access.</p>

      <p>Your SD card data does not contain personally identifiable information, except for your CPAP machine’s serial number. When creating a profile in OSCAR, do not include any personal information you do not wish to share.</p>

      <p>This service is delivered through Cloudflare tunneling. Your IP address is not revealed to or collected by this service. All data transmitted to and from the service is protected using SSL/TLS encryption while in transit. No Google browser analytics or any other data collection is in place by us. Cloudflare may have its own policies with respect to data travelling through their tunnel system.</p>

      <p>This service was built with a strong emphasis on security. Multiple safeguards and hardening measures have been implemented to reduce risk and protect user data. However, no web application can be guaranteed to be completely secure against all possible threats.</p>

      <p>By using this service, you agree to use it responsibly and not upload any content that is illegal, harmful, or inappropriate. Be aware that portions of this service were created using generative AI and therefore can be subject to unexpected behaviour.</p>
