      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>What is Tinfoil Hat Mode (End-to-End Encryption)?</h2>
      <p>
        Tinfoil Hat Mode adds application-layer encryption in your browser before files are uploaded.
        Files are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and the per-file key is wrapped with the uploader server's RSA public key.
        This means intermediaries only see ciphertext.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do this if HTTPS already exists?</h2>
      <p>
        Cloudflare-terminated TLS protects traffic on the network, but Cloudflare can still see plaintext while proxying content.
        Application-layer encryption helps address that shortcoming by keeping upload contents encrypted until they reach the uploader origin,
        where decryption happens server-side.
      </p>

      <h2>Is this required?</h2>
      <p>
        Not really. Resmed SD card files used by OSCAR generally do not contain personal identity data.
        This extra encryption is optional, provided as a courtesy, and included because it is a fun proof-of-concept.
