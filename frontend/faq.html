        <summary>What is Tinfoil Hat Mode (End-to-End Encryption)?</summary>
        <p>
          Tinfoil Hat Mode adds application-layer encryption in your browser before files are uploaded.
          Files are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and the per-file key is wrapped with the uploader server's RSA public
          key.
          This means intermediaries only see ciphertext.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why do this if HTTPS already exists?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Cloudflare-terminated TLS protects traffic on the network, but Cloudflare can still see plaintext while
          proxying content.
          Application-layer encryption helps address that shortcoming by keeping upload contents encrypted until they
          reach the uploader origin,
          where decryption happens server-side.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Is this required?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Not really required. Resmed SD card files used by OSCAR generally do not contain personal identity data.
          This extra encryption is optional, provided as a courtesy, and included because it is a fun proof-of-concept.

        <summary>What is a local anonymous account and how does it work?</summary>
        <p>
          Local accounts are offered as a privacy-first option for users who wish to remain fully anonymous instead of
          linking a third-party login like Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an intentional choice by the developer not to collect or store your email address. Instead, a highly
          secure password and a recovery phrase are generated for you automatically upon signup. By generating a
          password for you, the application ensures you cannot accidentally reuse a password you have used in another
          application, which protects your privacy and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because no email address is collected, there is no traditional "forgot password" reset email option. If you
          forget or lose your password and your recovery phrase, you must contact the administrator to have them
          manually reset your password.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I lose my password?</summary>
        <p>
          Because we do not collect email addresses, if you lose your generated password AND your recovery phrase, you
          will not be able to log in. To reset your password, you must contact the site administrator and explain the
          situation. They will be able to generate a new password for you.
